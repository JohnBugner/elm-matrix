# elm-matrix

A matrix is a collection that stores elements in a rectangular 2-dimensional grid. It's most useful for storing numbers and then doing matrix operations (such as addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transposition), but anything can be stored inside.

Internally, elements are stored in an array of arrays, and every function ensures that the shape stays rectangular.
